A server to host it - This can be on nearlyfreespeech.net.

A domain to point to the server - this is already on nfs.net, with angblev.com

A text editor for writing the html and css - Zach recommends [[Vim]], of course-- but it should be whichever one
is mad comfortable. 

A way to upload files from local computer to the remote server - [[Git]] would be a nice way to do this.
[[SFTP]] could also work, or [[rsync]].  All of these I'll need to figure out to (I am still using coda to
upload, but feel this could be stronger.)

Documentation for all of this - that's what this is!
