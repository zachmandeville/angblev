= Intentions =

This is a portfolio site for Angelica's artwork, in all the mediums it shows itself.  It is also a
way for us to remove ourselves entirely from Webflow.  She currently has a site, but it's hosted
through that other platform, which costs us like 20 a month.  So here we can keep all the site's
content, and the parts of the design we want, but for 5 cents a month instead.

The page covers three areas of her work:
- Comics
- Posters
- Gifs

In addition, there's a contact page which includes her email and other ways to reach her.

= Needs =

* Easy to maintain
  * It should not require a crazy amount of work to put a new poster up, or to change the text on
    some site.  Or, put another way, there should not be a lot of hurdles and hoops to do these
    things.  Reduce the amount of tools needed for accessing and updating the page.
* Control over Image Size and Placement
  * Webflow was terrible with this.  Each image has it's optimal size, and so she should be able to
    adjust each div to fit that.  The gifs should be well laid out in a grid without a lot of hard
    work.
* As free as possible
  * No more webflow
* Big chunky fonts and simple design. 
* Looks good on desktop and phone. RESPONSIVE BABY!!!

This page can be done all through html and css, and so this can act as a good way to feel more
comfortable and skilled with both!
